        <p class="intro">Welcome to my very first Rick and Morty front end project. Just a little bit about me as an entry level developer. After graduating with my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts, I didn't know which career path to follow. I thought I wanted a career
            in the medical field but I later realized I was no longer interested. I love science, math, and being creative and figured what better way to show those interests than becoming a software engineer. I chose a Rick and Morty Api because Rick
            and Morty is one of my favorite shows and I am happy I get to share that with all of you! Be sure to follow me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yianna-richey-aa00ba15b/" class="social-icon si-rounded si-small si-linkedin">linkedIn
                <i class="linkedIn"></i>
            </a> let's connect! I am open to collaborating, networking and future friendships.
