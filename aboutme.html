        <h2> Yianna Richey</h2>
        <p>Hello There ! Welcome to my very first Rick and Morty front end project, a little about me as a developer, I did not always know what I wanted to do for my career having graduated with my associates in Liberal arts, I thought I wanted to be in
            the health field but I later realized it was no longer my passion. I love science and math and being creative. Rick and Morty is one of my favorite shows and I am happy I get to share that with you all! I enjoyed this project be sure to follow
            me on linkedIn lets connect! I am opening to collaborating, networking, future friendships and opportunites.
        </p>
