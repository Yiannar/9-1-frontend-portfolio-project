#Frontend Portfolio Project

### User Stories

- As a user, I will be able to click on the home page which would contain a short summary on the Rick and Morty show so that the user can get an idea of the show if they do not know about it already and if they do know about the show they can find their favorite character and the episodes they're in.

-As a user, I can use the navigation bar to decide which page I would like to select for home page, character, and about me page.

- As a user, I will be able to click on the character page so that I can go to search for a particular character and their name, image, status, species, and episodes they are in.

- As a user, I can click on the about me page so that I can describe why I chose this api and a background story on who I am as a developer.
