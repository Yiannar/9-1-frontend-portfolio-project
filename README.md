# Yianna Richey 9-1-frontend-portfolio-project

In this portfolio, I've had the opportunity to design a webpage using the Rick and Morty Api. 

Page Setup
Getting started
Fork and clone this repository.

Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your command line. Then, run the following command:

code . 

This will open the code in VsCode.

Navigate to the bottom right hand side, to run the following command:

Go Live

Once you go like you will be able to interact with the website.

# Instructions:

- Once you go live click, you will see the home/landing page which will show a picture of Rick and Morty and a paragraph telling you about the show.
- Then select the characters page, once on the characters page input a character name such as ("rick, morty, summer, beth, etc"). As your output you will be seeing the characters' image, name, status, species and how many episodes they are featured in.
- After trying different characters select on the about me page which will tell you more about me as a developer.



### User Stories

- As a user, I will be able to click on the home page which would contain a short summary on the Rick and Morty show so that the user can get an idea of the show if they do not know about it already and if they do know about the show they can find their favorite character and the episodes they're in.

- As a user, I can use the navigation bar to decide which page I would like to select for home page, character, and about me page.

- As a user, I will be able to click on the character page so that I can go to search for a particular character and their image, name, status, species, and how many episodes they starred in.

- As a user, I can click on the about me page so that I can describe why I chose this api and a background story on who I am as a developer.
